## Fast Information Exchange in Proximity-based  Low-Power Wireless Networks. 
Deterministic neighbor discovery protocols are based on schedule listening and transmission phases to offer a deterministic guarantee on the worst-case neighbor discovery latency.

In this work, we propose protocol enhancements that allow for faster average discovery times while maintaining the same worst-case guarantees. Specifically, we propose an epidemic information dissemination mechanism to speed up the discovery times in deterministic neighbor discovery protocols. The main idea is to let each node broadcast information about the beaconing slot locations of already discovered neighbors, so that other nodes in the network that are neighbors to these nodes can discover them much earlier. This simple extension to classical neighbor discovery protocols has two key advantages which lead to strong performance improvements while still ensuring determinism in the discovery.
